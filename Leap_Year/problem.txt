The following pseudocode determines whether a year is a leap year or a common
year in the Gregorian calendar (and in the proleptic Gregorian calendar
before 1582). The year variable being tested is the integer representing
the number of the year in the Gregorian calendar.

if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
else (it is a leap year)
