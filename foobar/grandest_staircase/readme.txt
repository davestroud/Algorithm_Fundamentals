The Grandest Staircase Of Them All
==================================

With the LAMBCHOP doomsday device finished, Commander Lambda is 
preparing to debut on the galactic stage -- but in order to make
a grand entrance, Lambda needs a grand staircase! 
Lambda has given you an overview of the types of bricks available, 
plus a budget. You can buy different amounts of the different types 
of bricks (for example, 3 little pink bricks, or 5 blue lace bricks). 
Commander Lambda wants to know how many different types of staircases 
can be built with each amount of bricks, so they can pick the one with 
the most options. 

Each type of staircase should consist of 2 or more steps.  No two steps are 
allowed to be at the same height - each step must be lower than the previous 
one. All steps must contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified 
as the total amount of bricks that make up that step.
For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the 
staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and the second step 
having a height of 1: (# indicates a brick)

21

When N = 4, you still only have 1 staircase choice:

#
#
##
31
 
But when N = 5, there are two ways you can build a staircase from the 
given bricks. The two staircases can have heights (4, 1) or (3, 2), 
as shown below:

41

##
32

Write a function called solution(n) that takes a positive integer n and 
returns the number of different staircases that can be built from 
exactly n bricks. n will always be at least 3 (so you can have a 
staircase at all), but no more than 200, because Commander Lambda's 
not made of money!
