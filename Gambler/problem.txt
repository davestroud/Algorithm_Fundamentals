Our next example is representative of a widely used class of programs, where we
use computers to simulate what might happen in the real world, so that we can
make informed decisions in all kinds of complicated situations. Suppose a
gambler makes a series of fair $1 bets, starting with $50, and continue to
 play until she either goes broke or has $250. What are the chances that she
 will go home with $250, and how many bets might she expect to make before
 winning or losing

 It accepts three command-line arguments, the initial stake ($50),
 the goal amount ($250), and the number of times we want to simulate the game.
